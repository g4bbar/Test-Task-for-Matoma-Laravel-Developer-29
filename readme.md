Develop a module using Laravel that allows any user to create periodic tasks (every
day, every Monday, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, every 5th of each month,
every 5th of March of each year). The iteration duration is definable as
- from date A to date B.
- for N iterations.

The CRM displays the tasks as a LIST of tasks (not in
graphical calendar format) grouped by TASKS TODAY, TASKS TOMORROW,
TASKS NEXT WEEK, TASKS NEXT WEEK, TASKS NEXT. A pending task is
considered "completed" when marked as done.
